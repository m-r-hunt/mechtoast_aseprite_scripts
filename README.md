Mechtoast Aseprite Scripts
---

My Aseprite scripts. MIT licensed. Feel free to use or modify them if you want. They may or may not work properly though, so be careful.

To install, clone the repo into your Aseprite scripts directory (`File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder` in Aseprite). Restart Aseprite if it's open. Then the scripts should be available under `File > Scripts > mechtoast_aseprite_scripts` or whatever you named the repo folder.
